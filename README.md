### Example Table:

| Total Weight (kg) | Shipping Fee |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 7 kg              | 10 EGP       |
| 10 kg             | 10 EGP       |
| 11 kg             | 20 EGP       |
| 15 kg             | 20 EGP       |
| 21 kg             | 30 EGP       |

> **Formula:**  
> `Shipping Fee = 10 Ã— ceil(totalWeightInKg / 10)`
