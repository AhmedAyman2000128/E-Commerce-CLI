## ðŸ“„ Shipping Fee Calculation

- **10 EGP** for total weight â‰¤ 10 kg
- +10 EGP for every additional 10 kg or part thereof

### Example Table:

| Total Weight (kg) | Shipping Fee |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 7 kg              | 10 EGP       |
| 10 kg             | 10 EGP       |
| 11 kg             | 20 EGP       |
| 15 kg             | 20 EGP       |
| 21 kg             | 30 EGP       |

> **Formula:**  
> `Shipping Fee = 10 Ã— ceil(totalWeightInKg / 10)`

## ðŸš¨ Exceptions Handled
- EmptyCartException â€“ When trying to checkout with an empty cart
- ExpiredProductException â€“ When any cart item is expired
- InsufficientBalanceException â€“ When the customer's balance is insufficient

- Weight is entered in grams
- Date is entered in the following format : (day-month-year)
- Removing from cart functionality is added
- All exceptions are unchecked (runtime)
- Cart holds product references with corresponding quantity
